# Batch multiple point operations together with the Azure Cosmos DB SQL API SDK

The TransactionalBatch and TransactionalBatchResponse classes together are the key to composing and decomposing operations into a single logical step. Using these classes, you can write your code to perform multiple operations and then determine if they were completed successfully server-side.

In this lab, you’ll use the SDK, to perform two dual-item operations where you attempt to create two items as a single logical unit.

## Prepare your development environment

If you have not already cloned the lab code repository for **DP-420** to the environment where you're working on this lab, follow these steps to do so. Otherwise, open the previously cloned folder in **Visual Studio Code**.

1. Start **Visual Studio Code**.

    > &#128221; If you are not already familiar with the Visual Studio Code interface, review the [Getting Started documentation][code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted]

1. Open the command palette and run **Git: Clone** to clone the ``https://github.com/microsoftlearning/dp-420-cosmos-db-dev`` GitHub repository in a local folder of your choice.

    > &#128161; You can use the **CTRL+SHIFT+P** keyboard shortcut to open the command palette.

1. Once the repository has been cloned, open the local folder you selected in **Visual Studio Code**.

## Create an Azure Cosmos DB SQL API account and configure the SDK project

1. In a new web browser window or tab, navigate to the Azure portal (``portal.azure.com``).

1. Sign into the portal using the Microsoft credentials associated with your subscription.

1. Select **+ Create a resource**, search for *Cosmos DB*, and then create a new **Azure Cosmos DB SQL API** account resource with the following settings, leaving all remaining settings to their default values:

    | **Setting** | **Value** |
    | ---: | :--- |
    | **Subscription** | *Your existing Azure subscription* |
    | **Resource group** | *Select an existing or create a new resource group* |
    | **Account Name** | *Enter a globally unique name* |
    | **Location** | *Choose any available region* |
    | **Capacity mode** | *Provisioned throughput* |
    | **Apply Free Tier Discount** | *Apply* |

    > &#128221; Your lab environments may have restrictions preventing you from creating a new resource group. If that is the case, use the existing pre-created resource group.

1. Wait for the deployment task to complete before continuing with this task.

1. Go to the newly created **Azure Cosmos DB** account resource and navigate to the **Keys** pane.

1. This pane contains the connection details and credentials necessary to connect to the account from the SDK. Specifically:

    1. Record the value of the **URI** field. You will use this **endpoint** value later in this exercise.

    1. Record the value of the **PRIMARY KEY** field. You will use this **key** value later in this exercise.

1. Close your web browser window or tab.

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, in the **Explorer** pane, browse to the **07-sdk-batch** folder.

1. Open the **script.cs** code file within the **07-sdk-batch** folder.

    > &#128221; The **[Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos][nuget.org/packages/microsoft.azure.cosmos/3.22.1]** library has already been pre-imported from NuGet.

1. Locate the **string** variable named **endpoint**. Set its value to the **endpoint** of the Azure Cosmos DB account you created earlier.
  
    ```
    string endpoint = "<cosmos-endpoint>";
    ```

    > &#128221; For example, if your endpoint is: **https&shy;://dp420.documents.azure.com:443/**, then the C# statement would be: **string endpoint = "https&shy;://dp420.documents.azure.com:443/";**.

1. Locate the **string** variable named **key**. Set its value to the **key** of the Azure Cosmos DB account you created earlier.

    ```
    string key = "<cosmos-key>";
    ```

    > &#128221; For example, if your key is: **fDR2ci9QgkdkvERTQ==**, then the C# statement would be: **string key = "fDR2ci9QgkdkvERTQ==";**.

1. **Save** the **script.cs** code file.

1. Open the context menu for the **07-sdk-batch** folder and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal** to open a new terminal instance.

    > &#128221; This command will open the terminal with the starting directory already set to the **07-sdk-batch** folder.

1. Build the project using the [dotnet build][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build] command:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

1. Close the integrated terminal.

## Creating a transactional batch

First, let’s create a simple transactional batch that makes two fictional products. This batch will insert a worn saddle and a rusty handlebar into the container with the same “used accessories” category identifier. Both items have the same logical partition key, ensuring that we will have a successful batch operation.

1. Return to the editor tab for the **script.cs** code file.

1. Create a **Product** variable named **saddle** with a unique identifier of **0120**, a name of **Worn Saddle**, and a category identifier of **9603ca6c-9e28-4a02-9194-51cdb7fea816**:

    ```
    Product saddle = new("0120", "Worn Saddle", "9603ca6c-9e28-4a02-9194-51cdb7fea816");
    ```

1. Create a **Product** variable named **handlebar** with a unique identifier of **012A**, a name of **Rusty Handlebar**, and a category identifier of **9603ca6c-9e28-4a02-9194-51cdb7fea816**:

    ```
    Product handlebar = new("012A", "Rusty Handlebar", "9603ca6c-9e28-4a02-9194-51cdb7fea816");
    ```
